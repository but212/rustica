# Rustica TODO List

## Project Status

- **Current Focus**: Implementing and documenting functional programming patterns in Rust
- **Last Updated**: 2025-03-24

## High Priority Tasks

### Type Class Implementation
- [x] Implement Functor trait with ownership-aware API design
- [x] Provide comprehensive benchmark suite for monads (State monad)
- [x] Implement Validated type (accumulating errors unlike Result)
- [x] Complete MonadError for better error handling
- [ ] Add more monad transformers (ReaderT, StateT, etc.)
- [x] Implement MonadPlus for alternative computations

### Documentation
- [x] Document Functor laws and implementations
- [x] Document Validated type with comprehensive examples
- [ ] Add more code examples for each trait implementation
- [ ] Document doctest best practices (explicit type annotations, trait imports)
- [ ] Create tutorial-style documentation for beginners
- [ ] Document performance characteristics for each implementation

### Testing
- [x] Add benchmarks for State monad operations
- [ ] Implement property-based tests for all category laws
- [ ] Complete comprehensive test suite for all monads
- [ ] Create test utilities for common testing patterns
- [ ] Implement regression tests for known edge cases

## Medium Priority Tasks

### Category Theory
- [ ] Document category theory concepts more thoroughly with examples
- [ ] Add visual diagrams for category relationships
- [ ] Add more type-level programming capabilities
- [ ] Implement type classes for common patterns

### Ergonomics
- [ ] Add more convenience methods
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Consider adding proc macros for boilerplate
- [ ] Add more utility functions for common operations

### Performance
- [x] Add inline attributes to optimize trait methods
- [x] Separate ownership-based and reference-based methods
- [ ] Add zero-cost abstractions where possible
- [ ] Profile and improve memory usage
- [ ] Consider adding compile-time optimizations

## Infrastructure & Community

### Build System
- [x] Add continuous integration
- [x] Set up automated release process
- [x] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement automated documentation deployment

### Quality Assurance
- [x] Add linting rules
- [x] Set up automated code formatting
- [ ] Implement security scanning
- [ ] Add performance regression testing

### Community Building
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Add code of conduct
- [ ] Improve README with getting started guide
- [ ] Create FAQ document
- [ ] Write blog posts about implementation details

## Future Considerations

### Language Features
- [ ] Consider support for newer Rust features
- [ ] Evaluate async/await integration (Async Monad)
- [ ] Consider adding more derive macros
- [ ] Investigate GAT usage when stable
- [ ] Make compatible with dynamic dispatch (dyn)

### Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] Add integrations with popular Rust libraries
- [ ] Consider creating companion crates
- [ ] Add serialization support

## Examples and Tutorials
- [ ] Create real-world example applications
- [ ] Create cookbook with common patterns
- [ ] Add examples for concurrent programming
- [ ] Document best practices and anti-patterns
- [ ] Create video tutorials
- [ ] Create interactive examples

## Maintenance
