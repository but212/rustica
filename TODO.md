# Rustica TODO

**PERFORMANCE NOTICE**: This library has 20-100x overhead compared to direct Rust code.

## Priority: High (Target v0.10.0) - Immediate Fixes

### Critical Maintenance

- [ ] Fix documentation inconsistencies
  - [ ] Remove false "zero-cost" claims from docs
  - [ ] Add performance warnings to all public APIs
  - [ ] Update examples with realistic use case guidance
- [ ] Code quality improvements
  - [ ] Fix remaining clippy warnings
  - [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
  - [ ] Remove unused dependencies from Cargo.toml
- [ ] Testing improvements
  - [ ] Fix failing tests if any
  - [ ] Add integration tests for common workflows
  - [ ] Validate all documented examples work

### User Experience

- [ ] Improve getting started experience
  - [ ] Simplify README examples
  - [ ] Add clear performance expectations to docs
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Priority: Medium (Target v0.11.0) - Incremental Improvements

### Documentation & Learning Resources

- [ ] Educational content
  - [ ] Write "When to Use Rustica" guide
  - [ ] Create comparison with direct Rust implementations
  - [ ] Add more practical examples to docs
  - [ ] Write migration guide from Rustica to production code
- [ ] API improvements
  - [ ] Review and simplify public APIs
  - [ ] Add convenience methods for common patterns
  - [ ] Improve error messages for better developer experience

### Limited Feature Additions

- [ ] Serde support (already partially implemented)
  - [ ] Complete serde integration for all data types
  - [ ] Add serialization examples
  - [ ] Test roundtrip serialization
- [ ] Enhanced lens functionality (only if performance acceptable)
  - [ ] Add lens composition utilities
  - [ ] Improve lens error handling

## Priority: Low (Long-term Research) - Academic/Research Goals

### Performance Research

- [ ] Investigate optimization opportunities
  - [ ] Profile Arc allocation patterns
  - [ ] Research zero-copy alternatives for specific use cases
  - [ ] Experiment with compile-time optimization techniques
- [ ] Alternative implementations
  - [ ] Research stack-based closure alternatives
  - [ ] Investigate partial specialization for performance paths
  - [ ] Consider trait object alternatives

### Advanced Features (Research Only)

- [ ] Category theory extensions
  - [ ] Profunctor optics (research implementation)
  - [ ] Comonadic patterns exploration
  - [ ] Advanced transformer compositions
- [ ] Educational tools
  - [ ] Interactive learning materials
  - [ ] Visualization tools for category theory concepts
  - [ ] Performance comparison tools

## Explicitly Rejected Ideas

### Not Pursuing (Performance Prohibitive)

- **High-performance persistent vectors**: 20-100x overhead makes this impractical
- **Production web framework integration**: Performance overhead too high
- **Game engine integration**: Real-time requirements incompatible
- **System programming applications**: Overhead unacceptable
- **Massive ecosystem integration**: Limited by fundamental performance issues

### Not Pursuing (Scope Creep)

- **Library modularization**: Single crate is sufficient for current scope
- **Comprehensive tokio integration**: Async overhead compounds existing issues
- **Advanced macro systems**: Complexity not justified by educational benefits

## Realistic Project Metrics

### Achievable Goals

- [ ] Test coverage: maintain above 80% (currently high)
- [ ] Documentation coverage: maintain 95%+ (currently good)
- [ ] Build time: keep under 30 seconds for full build
- [ ] Zero clippy warnings on default settings

### Performance Reality Check

- **Current state**: 20-100x slower than direct Rust
- **Realistic target**: Maybe reduce to 10-50x slower with optimizations
- **Fundamental limit**: Arc indirection will always have significant overhead
- **Honest assessment**: Will never be suitable for performance-critical code

## Success Criteria Redefinition

### Educational Success

- Correct implementation of category theory concepts
- Clear learning path for functional programming in Rust
- Good examples and documentation

### Practical Success

- Limited to prototyping and research use cases
- Focus on correctness over performance
- Maintain as reference implementation for categorical concepts

## Version Roadmap (Realistic)

- **v0.10.1**: Fix documentation, improve examples, stabilize API
- **v0.11.0**: Enhanced educational content, limited feature additions
- **v1.0.0**: Stable educational/research library (no performance promises)

This TODO reflects the reality that Rustica is primarily an educational and research tool, not a production-ready high-performance library.
