# CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Path Caching for PersistentVector Tree**
    - Implemented path/range caching in the internal tree structure for `PersistentVector`.
    - Added `get_with_path` and `get_by_path` methods to `Node<T>` to record and utilize traversal paths and ranges for efficient repeated access.
    - The treeâ€™s `get_with_cache` now records and reuses traversal paths, improving cache hit performance for repeated or nearby accesses.
    - Added validation logic `validate_cache_path` to ensure cached paths/ranges are only used when still valid for the current tree structure.
    - Tree modifications (push, update, split, etc.) automatically invalidate the cache to prevent stale accesses.

### Improvements & Bug Fixes
- Added validation logic for path/ranges cache in PersistentVector tree.
    - Now, when the tree structure changes or if the cached path/ranges are no longer valid, the cache is safely treated as a miss.
    - Introduced the `validate_cache_path` method, which ensures that the cached path and ranges match the current tree structure before using the cache in `get_with_cache`.
    - Tree-modifying operations (such as push, update, etc.) continue to invalidate the cache to ensure consistency.

## [0.7.0]

### Added
- Added `iso_lens.rs` and `iso_prism.rs` for Iso-based optics (Lens/Prism) with lawful composition, full documentation, and doctest examples.
- `IsoLens` and `IsoPrism` now support lawful composition for deep, type-safe focusing into nested product/sum types.
- **MonadPlus** and **Alternative** traits implemented for core datatypes:
    - `Maybe<T>`, `Either<L, R>`, `Validated<E, A>`, `Choice<T>`: All now support monadic choice, failure, and error accumulation where appropriate.
    - `Alternative` trait: Supported for `Maybe<T>`, `Either<L, R>` (with `L: Default`), `Validated<E, A>` (with `E: Default`).
- `Choice<T>::flatten_sorted()`: Flattens and sorts alternatives; see below for example.
- Iterator support (`IntoIterator`) for all core datatypes: `Maybe`, `Validated`, `Id`, `Writer`, `Either` (including left/right iterators). All implementations are documented and tested for idiomatic Rust usage.

  Example:
  ```rust
  let nested = Choice::new(vec![3, 1], vec![vec![5, 2], vec![4]]);
  let flat = nested.flatten_sorted();
  assert_eq!(*flat.first().unwrap(), 3);
  assert_eq!(flat.alternatives(), &[1, 2, 4, 5]);
  ```

### Changed
- **[Breaking] Changed `Choice<T>::flatten()` behavior:**
  - Now preserves original order; sorting is provided by `flatten_sorted()`.
- **[Breaking] Refactored `Validated` datatype:**
  - Unified invalid cases, now uses iterators for error accumulation.
- **[Breaking] Removed `to_state`, `to_state_t`, `from_state_t`, `to_reader`, `from_reader`, `to_cont`, `from_cont` methods from State/Reader/Cont:**
  - All transformer-to-base conversions are now handled via the `From` trait (see below for migration).
- **[Breaking] Removed WriterT transformer:**
  - The WriterT transformer and all related code have been deleted.
  - WriterT is rarely useful in practical Rust code; most logging/accumulation use-cases are better served by explicit fields or iterators.
  - If monadic logging is needed, consider direct accumulation patterns or external loggers instead.
- **[Breaking] Refactored the `prelude` module:**
  - Prelude is now split into multiple logical modules: `traits`, `traits_ext`, `datatypes`, `wrapper`, `transformer`, and `utils` under `src/prelude/`.
  - Added `prelude::traits_ext` for extension traits (e.g., `EvaluateExt`, `FunctorExt`, etc.).
  - Users can now selectively import only the needed prelude components, improving ergonomics and compile times.
  - Top-level `prelude` now re-exports all submodules for convenience.
- **Enhanced `NaturalTransformation` trait:**
  - Added documentation, usage examples, and improved ergonomics.

## [Unifying Transformer Conversions]

### Breaking Change: Unified Transformer-to-Base Conversions via `From` Trait

- All conversions from transformer types to their respective base types are now standardized using the `From` trait:
    - `From<ReaderT<E, Id<A>, A>> for Reader<E, A>`
    - `From<StateT<S, Id<(A, S)>, A>> for State<S, A>`
    - `From<ContT<R, Id<R>, A>> for Cont<R, A>`
- Legacy conversion methods such as `to_reader`, `from_reader`, `to_state`, `from_state`, `to_cont`, `from_cont` have **all been removed** from the codebase.
- This change ensures a clear, unified, and idiomatic Rust API for all monad/transformer conversions.

#### Migration Guide
- To convert from a transformer to a base type, use the `From` trait or `.into()`:
  ```rust
  let base: State<i32, i32> = State::from(state_t);
  let cont: Cont<i32, i32> = cont_t.into();
  let reader: Reader<i32, i32> = reader_t.into();
  ```
- Update any code using the removed methods to use the `From` trait or `.into()` instead.

## [0.6.4] - 2025-04-18

### Changed
- **Continuation Monad (`Cont`) Refactored**
  - `Cont` is now implemented as a thin wrapper over the more general `ContT` (Continuation Monad Transformer).
  - All core logic and methods (`new`, `run`, `pure`, `bind`, `fmap`, `apply`, `call_cc`, etc.) delegate to `ContT` for improved modularity and code reuse.
  - This refactor enables seamless integration with other monads and makes the continuation monad implementation more idiomatic and extensible.
  - The public API remains mostly unchanged, but closure signatures for `Cont::new` are now more ergonomic and consistent with transformer usage.
  - Comprehensive documentation and tests updated to reflect the new structure.

## [0.6.3] - 2025-04-17

### Added
- **Continuation Monad Transformer (`ContT`)**
  - Introduced `ContT<R, M, A>`, a monad transformer version of the continuation monad.

  - Implements the `MonadTransformer` trait for seamless integration with other monads.
  - Comprehensive documentation and usage examples included.
  - Fixes and improvements for trait bounds and closure handling for safe, idiomatic Rust.

## [0.6.2] - 2025-04-17

### Added

- **Iso Trait Enhancements**
  - Added `ResultValidatedIso` for seamless conversion between `Result` and `Validated`

### IO Monad Improvements
- Refactored IO<A>:
  - Internal implementation now uses `Arc<dyn Fn()>` with minimal value cloning for better performance and ergonomics.
  - `pure`, `delay`, `delay_efficient` now only clone values when IO is run multiple times, reducing unnecessary heap allocations.
  - `delay_efficient` now uses the `spin_sleep` crate for precise spin-based delays; `delay` continues to use `std::thread::sleep`.
  - Each method is now thoroughly documented, including tradeoffs between blocking and spinning, and async/await extension notes.
  - Doctests improved to follow Rust best practices for generics, trait imports, and error handling.
