/// A representable functor is a functor that is naturally isomorphic to a function type.
///
/// In category theory, a functor F is representable if there exists an object R such that
/// F(A) â‰… Hom(R, A) for all objects A. This means the functor can be "represented" by
/// functions from some fixed type R.
///
/// # Laws
///
/// A valid representable functor must satisfy the isomorphism laws:
///
/// 1. **tabulate andThen index == identity**:
///    ```text
///    index(tabulate(f), r) = f(r)
///    ```
///
/// 2. **index andThen tabulate == identity**:
///    ```text
///    tabulate(|r| index(fa, r)) = fa
///    ```
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Common representable functors include:
/// - Functions: `(->) R` is represented by `R`
/// - Streams/infinite lists: represented by natural numbers
/// - Trees with a specific shape: represented by paths through the tree
